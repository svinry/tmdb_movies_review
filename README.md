# Investigating a Dataset TMDB Movie Dataset

## Introduction

This is my submition to udacity's project: Investigating a Dataset

## Dataset

I have chosen the TMDB Movie Dataset which is a collection of over 10,000 movie review collected from The Movie Database (TMDb). I will perfom data cleaning using Python and the NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib libraries.  


# Conclusions

From the investigation it appears there is a correlation between a movie budget and the votes it receives. On average, the cost for making a western movies is higher tha all other, this may be resultant form inflation adjustment. Drama is the most made movie genre, this maybe because it is amoung the least costly movie genre to make. More movies are being made each year accoss all genres. Western movies are the most popular, this maybe the amoung the first movie genres to be made.
